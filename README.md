# Weather-App
This is a weather app made in Vanilla(pure) JavaScript.
## Description
The project I had  built is “Note Taking Website App Using Pure JavaScript.” We all have a notes app on our mobiles or laptop. Note-taking websites are the online equivalent of notebooks, and because they are digital, they can do more for you than paper ever could.


### Languages Used

Frontend :

1) HTML
2) CSS
3) JAVA SCRIPT

Framework: Bootstrap

### Getting Started
For this project, I had used  VS Code.
The project setup is really simple. Because we only want to use JavaScript without any frameworks. Start by creating a new project folder in VS Code, and inside that project folder, create two empty new files: Note2.html and index.js. The Note2.html file is the entry point for our website and contains the HTML code. In this project, we are also using Bootstrap.
